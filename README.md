# stable_difusion_in_image_generationProject Overview
This project is a Stable Diffusion Image Generator built with Streamlit. It allows users to generate images from text prompts using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. The app provides an intuitive interface where users can input a prompt, choose the desired image size, and generate an image on the fly.

Features
Text-based image generation using Stable Diffusion.
Customizable image size options (256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024).
User-friendly interface with a sidebar for prompt input and settings.
Real-time image generation with display of the elapsed time.
Custom background and themed UI to enhance user experience.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
CUDA-compatible GPU for acceleration (recommended)
Required libraries:
torch
diffusers
streamlit
PIL (Pillow)
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stable-diffusion-image-generator.git
cd stable-diffusion-image-generator
Install the required dependencies:

pip install torch diffusers streamlit Pillow
Ensure you have a CUDA-compatible environment for running the model with GPU acceleration.

Running the App
Download the pre-trained Stable Diffusion v1-4 model and extract it to the temp_extracted_model folder (or your preferred location).

Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py
Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:8501/.

How to Use
Enter a text prompt: Describe the image you want to generate (e.g., "A futuristic cityscape at sunset").
Select image size: Choose from 256x256, 512x512, or 1024x1024.
Click the "Generate Image" button to create the image.
View the generated image and the time it took to generate.
Customization
Background Image
You can change the background by replacing download.jpeg with another image in the add_bg_from_local() function.
Model Path
Modify the model_load_path to point to the directory where the Stable Diffusion model is stored.
Notes
This app uses a mixed-precision approach (torch.float16) for faster computation with GPUs.
Make sure your system supports CUDA to leverage the full potential of this app.
